## Hi there 👋
   # I’m Usman

I am a computer science student with a strong interest in programming and problem solving. I enjoy building small but complete projects and learning how things work under the hood.

# Skills and tools:
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=flat&logo=openjdk)
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032?style=flat&logo=git)

- ***Languages:***     Java, Python, C, C++ 
- ***Web:***           HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- ***Tools:***         Git, GitHub

# Projects:
- SecurePass – A console-based password manager with admin and user roles, built in Java.
  [View Project Repo](https://github.com/UsmanFang/SecurePass)
- HomeE

# Currently learning📚:
- Improving Java fundamentals
- Writing cleaner and more maintainable code


<!--
===============================================================================================================================================================
Lists
- Java
- Python
- Git

Ordered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Links
Instead of pasting the link alone, do this:
[SecurePass](https://github.com/UsmanFang/SecurePass)

**bold text**
*italic text*

===============================================================================================================================================================


2. Badges (those small skill labels)
Badges are images that show skills cleanly.
Example:
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=flat&logo=openjdk)
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032?style=flat&logo=git)
Rules:
put badges under headings
do not overuse
4 to 6 badges max


3. Making projects look serious

Instead of a plain list, do this:
- **SecurePass**  
  Console-based password manager with admin and user roles.  
  Tech: Java, File Handling  
  [Repository](https://github.com/UsmanFang/SecurePass)
  
This instantly looks professional.


4. Line breaks (this matters)
Markdown ignores single line breaks.
Use:
empty line → new paragraph
two spaces at end of line → forced break
Example:
Line one.␠␠
Line two.


5. Centering text (optional, advanced)
GitHub allows basic HTML.
<p align="center">
  Computer Science Student | Java Developer
</p>
Use HTML sparingly.


6. Skill grouping (cleaner look)
Instead of one long list:
**Languages:** Java, Python, C, C++  
**Web:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub

===============================================================================================================================================================
**UsmanFang/UsmanFang** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
